// REST API / RESTFULL API -> representional state transfer

//server client architecture -> every req must be stateless -> no session store in server

// in modern time rest api mostly send json -> we can send anything like xml , html but we send json so client is not dependent on server

//JSON -> javascript object notation ->  client less depeendent on serever -> client easily handle this  -> language independent

// always req http methdods

// like for create use POST
// for get somthing use GET
// for update use PATCH / PUT
// for delete use DELETE

// also respect http status code lik 201,200,404

// that thing make rest api

// html is fast that's why client side render is slow (CSR) -> server side render is fast (SSR)
